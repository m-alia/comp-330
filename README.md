  # Personal Task Tracker UI

  This is a code bundle for Personal Task Tracker UI. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/U31Lk9eT1D0l0NcLAVkSnn/Personal-Task-Tracker-UI.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  If you receive a message similar to `command not found: npm`, you may need to install npm and Node.js
  Instructions for instillation can be found here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

  After downloading the repo, navigate to the project folder and use `python setup_db.py`

  Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend.

  You'll probably receive a lot of security warnings when running this command, if you're on a mac, you can open your privacy and security settings, and manually override the warnings and say "open anyway" whenever prompted, and eventually it should let you run the app.

  If on Windows, you can temporarily disable your app screening. First, open your settings, and navigate to the "Privacy & Security" tab, and then open "Windows Security." Next, open "App & Browser Control" and go to "Reputation-Based Protection Settings." From there, you can temporarily disable "Check apps and files."

  Open up a second terminal window and navigate to the project folder and run `python app.py` to start the backend.

  # Personal Task Tracker UI

  This is a code bundle for Personal Task Tracker UI. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/U31Lk9eT1D0l0NcLAVkSnn/Personal-Task-Tracker-UI.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  After downloading the repo, navigate to the project folder and use `python setup_db.py`

  Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend.

  You'll probably receive a lot of security warnings when running this command, if you're on a mac, you can open your privacy and security settings, and manually override the warnings and say "open anyway" whenever prompted, and eventually it should let you run the app.

  Open up a second terminal window and navigate to the project folder and run `python app.py` to start the backend.
